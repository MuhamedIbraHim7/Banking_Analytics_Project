# Banking Analytics Project Documentation

## 1. Project Overview

The Banking Analytics Project provides advanced analytics and machine learning solutions for the banking sector, focusing on:
- **Customer Churn Prediction**: Identifying customers likely to leave the bank.
- **Loan Default Prediction**: Assessing the risk of loan default using integrated customer and loan data.

**Key Features:**
- End-to-end data extraction, preprocessing, and feature engineering for churn and loan models.
- Machine learning model training, evaluation, and interpretation (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting).
- Ready-to-use Jupyter Notebooks for reproducible analysis and business insights.
- Model serialization for deployment and integration.
- Azure Machine Learning integration for scalable model training (loan prediction).

**Target Users:**
- Data scientists, ML engineers, and banking analytics teams.

**High-Level Architecture:**
- Data extraction scripts → Preprocessing → Model training (notebooks/scripts) → Model evaluation → Deployment-ready artifacts

## 2. Installation & Setup

**Environment Requirements:**
- Python 3.8+
- Recommended: Use a virtual environment

**Dependencies:**
See `requirements.txt` for a full list. Key packages:
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, joblib
- scikit-learn, shap, imblearn
- azure-ai-ml, azure-identity, mlflow, azureml-mlflow
- jupyter

**Installation Steps:**
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project root.
2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/Mac
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

**Configuration:**
- Place raw banking datasets (Excel/CSV) in the appropriate folders.
- Update Azure ML workspace credentials in the loan prediction notebook as needed.

## 4. Workflow Guide

**Typical Usage:**
1. Prepare raw data and place in the correct folders.
2. Run extraction scripts to preprocess data.
3. Open the relevant Jupyter notebook and follow the workflow:
   - Data exploration
   - Feature engineering
   - Model training and evaluation
   - Model interpretation (e.g., SHAP)
4. Save trained models for deployment.

**Sample Workflow:**
```sh
python Churn_Model_Prediction/extract_churn_data.py
jupyter notebook Churn_Model_Prediction/Bank_Churn_Complete_Notebook.ipynb
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use virtual environments to manage dependencies.
- Version control your data and models.
- Use Azure ML for scalable training.

## 5. Data Structures

- **Input Data:** CSV/Excel files with customer and loan information.
- **Processed Data:**
  - `churn_prediction_data.csv`, `loan_data_preprocessed.csv`, etc.
- **Model Artifacts:**
  - `.pkl` files for trained models.

**Schema Example:**
| Column         | Type    | Description                |
| -------------- | ------- | -------------------------- |
| CustomerID     | int     | Unique customer identifier |
| LoanAmount     | float   | Amount of the loan         |
| ...            | ...     | ...                        |

## 6. Algorithm Explanations

- **Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting** used for classification tasks.
- **SHAP** for model interpretation.
- **SMOTE** for handling class imbalance.

**Complexity:**
- Training time depends on data size and model complexity.

**Limitations:**
- Data quality and feature selection impact model performance.
- Azure ML integration requires valid credentials and subscription.

---

## 7. Troubleshooting

- **Common Issues:**
  - Missing dependencies: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
  - Data file not found: Check file paths and names.
  - Azure ML errors: Verify workspace credentials and network access.

- **Debugging Tips:**
  - Use print statements and notebook outputs to inspect data.
  - Check logs for error messages.

---

## 8. Extension Points

- **Adding New Models:**
  - Extend notebooks/scripts with additional algorithms.
- **Custom Features:**
  - Modify feature engineering steps in extraction scripts.
- **Deployment:**
